[Work in Progress] Code Implementations of Different Alignment Methods

Instruction Tuning seems to be the sole approach to align an LLM at the moment. In this repo, we have simple implementation of PPO, DPO and IPO. 

# TODOs
1. Read PPO algorithm paper
2. Implement on a non-LLM setting
3. Implement for a small Pythia LLM.
